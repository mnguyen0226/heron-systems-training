1. Read in data and with appropriate transforms
2. Set up TensorBoard
3 Write to TensorBoard
4. Inspect a model architecture using TensorBoard
5. Use TensorBoard to create interactive versions of the visualizations
    - inspect the training data
    - how to track model's performance as it trains
    - how to assess our model's performance once it is trained
