# Greedy is a algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the 
# next piece that offers the most obviose and immediate benefit.
# For the problems where chooding locally optimal also leads to gloabal solution are best fit for Greedy

About Greedy Algorithms: https://skerritt.blog/greedy-algorithms/

- Greedy Algorithms aim to make the optima choice at the given moment. Rach step it chooses the 
optimal choice, without knowing the future.
- It attepst to find the globally optimal way to solve the entire problem using this method
- Greedy Property = At that exact moement in time, what is the optimal choice to make
- This means that the overall optimal solution may differ from the solution the algorhsm choose
