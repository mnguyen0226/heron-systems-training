# file create a training functions for the seq2seq model. Should be the same with minh's gated Transformers

# Don't worry too much about device when first build. After finish getting it to train on CPU
# look at the trianing on the original gated transformers and look at where the transformer use device then
# set the input output in Seq2Seq to train on GPU
