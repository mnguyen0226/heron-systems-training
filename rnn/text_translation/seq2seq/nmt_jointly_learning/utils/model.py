ENCODER:
- Single GRU, but we will use bidirectional RNN
- Bidirectional RNN = have 2 RNNs in each layers.
    + forward RNN goes over the embedded sentence from left to right
    + backward RNN goes over the embbedd sentence from right to left
    + bidirectional
- We pass input embedded to RNN which tell Pytorch to initialize both the fw and bw initial hidden state to a tensor of all zeros.
- We will get 2 context vector, 1 for forward RNN after it has seen the final word in a sentence, and one from the backward rnn after it has seen the frist word in the senten

Attention layer:
- This takes in the previous hidden state of the decoder and all of the stacked forward and backward hidden states from the encoder
- The layer will output an attention vector that is the length of the source sentence, each element is between 0 and 1 and the entire vector sums to 1

- Meaning: this layer takes what we have decoded sofar and all of what we have encoded to produce attention vector that represents which word in the source sentence we should pay most attention to in order to correclty predict the net word to decode

Steps:
- First we calculate the energy between the previous decoder hidden state and the encoder hidden state.
- This can be thought of as calculating how well each encoder hidden state matches the previous decoder hidden state
- v as weights for a weighted sum of the energy across all encoder hidden state. These wegiths tell us how much we should attent to each token in a source sequence
- i are initialzed randomly but learned with the rest of the model via backpropagation. Note how v is not dependent on time
- v is used for each time-step of the deciduibg
